This interface allows new users to sign up by entering their credentials, email, phone number, and vault name. The form ensures data validation before submission, enabling secure account creation.

### OTP Email Verification

![OTP Email](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7260c579-37d4-47c1-a5de-15573c12109b)

Upon registration, a One-Time Password (OTP) is sent to the user's registered email for verification, ensuring secure authentication.

### Login Page
